-- This query identifies indexes that are never used for read operations (seeks, scans, lookups).
-- It joins usage statistics with object and index metadata to show the table and index names.
-- Results are ordered by the number of updates, highlighting indexes that add write overhead without read benefits.
-- Use this to find potential candidates for removal to improve write performance and free up resources.
